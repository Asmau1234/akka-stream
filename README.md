# akka-stream
This is just a simple demonstration of how akka streams works.

It describes how to initialise a Source element that emits integers, a Flow to receives input and transforms it and a Sink which is a receiver that receives integers and prints the transformed data to the console. 

There are two demonstrations here, one is how to use a simple stream (Source, Flow, Sink) and the one ran in main creates an Akka Streams of some shape using the Graph DSL.
